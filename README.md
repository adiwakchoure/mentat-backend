# Getting Started

## User Interface

Mentat features a clean and intuitive user interface deployed on Vercel, using their AI SDK to ensure a smooth and world class experience. Users can interact with the market research agent and access valuable competitive intelligence.

## Backend

The backend is a FastAPI app not fully functional yet (ORM troubles). `prototype.ipynb` is a good starting point to show my approach - a multi step reasoning tree via AI agents (currently GPT 3.5 but only gets better)
